# Smart-Face-Mood-Scorer
This project is a Smart Facial Expression Classifier built with OpenCV &amp; Streamlit. It uses a rule-based scoring engine on Haar Cascade features (smile, eyes, mouth curve, brightness) to classify faces as 'Happy' or 'Not Happy'. Focuses on reliable, feature-centric analysis over complex CNN models.
